# PortfolioCS300

Within the projects of the course, we were trying to figure out what the best algorithm would be to use for reading in a csv file of course numbers, names, and prerequisites into
a data structure that would have good timing for running the program. I looked at the three data structures we were using binary search tree, vector, and linked lists. I weighed
the pros and cons for each structure by analyzing both utility and speed. I found that the binary search tree was the quickest and best method for my program. The project helped
to expand my knowledge on algorithms and to consider which is best fitted. It helped me to also consider the utility and speed of a data structure or program that makes a program
maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Some structures can be more flexible than others when it comes to new information being added or manipulated.
